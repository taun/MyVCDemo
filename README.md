# MyVc Demo

This is an iOS application written in Swift 4.0 to demonstrate the continued effectiveness of old school MVC (Model View Controller) when done properly.

This was written to accompany a talk given at the Sept. 14th, 2017, Philadelphia Chapter of CocoaHeads. (Link needed)

The slides for the talk are located (Link Needed).

This demo app was functionally completed literally 15 minutes before the talk started. It is still raw and uncommented as well as unedited and not refactored. Please take that into consideration when looking at the code.

It main purpose is to show:

* How easy it is to customise views.
* How useful custom views are for given an app a consistent look and feel.
* How using a custom view prevents the ViewController from needing to know about the model leading to leaner ViewControllers.
* Custom views are composable and more re-usable.
* Custom views can easily react to model changes using standard CocoaTouch and Swift 4 patterns. There is no need for RxReact patterns.


## Telekinesis

This app also demostrates how PaintCode (Link Needed) can be used to help with easily theming an app. 

Telekinesis is not yet used for the app. Just a PaintCode Stylekit.
